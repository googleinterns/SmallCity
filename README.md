# SmallCity

| Created by Abakir Hanna, Ethan Mooney, and Lindsey Weiskopf


### Objective

We aim to create a web platform for users to find products from local small businesses. Our web app will increase exposure to local businesses of interest in their community. 


### Background

The U.S Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy defines a small business as a company with fewer than 500 employees. These small businesses are an integral part of the worldâ€™s economy and are often overlooked. Making up 44% of economic activity in the US, small businesses often struggle to keep up with the growing demand for instant delivery via online shopping. Only amplified during crises like the Covid-19 pandemic, the uphill battle that these businesses face poses a real threat to their stability and, in turn, the US economy.

Right now, many small local businesses get lost in the shadow of large businesses on online shopping platforms. But, as buyers continue to purchase more products from the comfort of their own homes, we want to give them an option to support the businesses in their community with ease. In a 2020 survey by Salesforce, 86% of consumers reported that they would pay more to support a small local business. Giving users the ability to filter for small local businesses on an already trusted platform like Google Shopping would allow users to shop locally from wherever they are while boosting local economies.
